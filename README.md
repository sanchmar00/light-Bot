# light-bot
Programing is the way people tell a computer what to do and how to function using intructions that a computer understands.
When playing light bot you learn how to program the robot using icons, so in a way you are learning real programing.You learn how frustrating it can be to get a computer to do what you want it to do, and get a glimps of what prgramers do.

This was my first time playing light bot, im new to progarming.playing this game gave me a better understanding of what programing is and the things that go into it.When i was playing the game I progresively i started to improve and get a bettter understanding of the controlls to complete complicated taks.
